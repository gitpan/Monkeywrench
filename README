NAME

    Monkeywrench - Web site testing application

DESCRIPTION

    Monkeywrench is a test-harness application to test the integrity
    of a user's path through a web site.
    
    To run HTTP::Monkeywrench->test, first set up a Perl script that contains
    sessions (described below), settings if desired (also described below),
    and a call to HTTP::Monkeywrench->test, passing it the settings hashref
    first, followed by the desired session hashrefs you want to test.
    HTTP::Monkeywrench->test($settings, $session1,... $sessionN)
    
    Monkeywrench can also be used in an object-oriented fashion -- simply
    take the result of HTTP::Monkeywrench->new (optionally passing the settings
    hashref) and call the test() method against it as above (optionally
    omitting the settings hashref.)
    
    Each session arrayref contains one or more hashrefs, called clicks,  
    which contain descriptive elements of a specific web page to be tested. 
    The elements are described below under SESSION.

INSTALLATION

    To install Monkeywrench, run the standard sequence:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
